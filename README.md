My Collection  of financial Wisdom for the longtime investor

Diversifikation!

The best way to hedge your riskâ€¦is to sell your risk.

invest without forecasts (Exceptions only if you are a leading expert in the topic you are investing in)

don't double up on bad trades

## Can't reliable beat the market, exept with Factor Etfs
* * Value.
* * Small Caps.
* * Momentum.
* * Low Volatility.
* * Dividenden.
* * Quality.

## financial relevant cognitive biases
* Anchoring (Don't wait for a bad trade  to break even)
* Confirmation Bias (find pro an d contra arguments for your investment)
* Declinism (Be more Optimistic)
* sunk cost fallacy (aka excalation of commitment)
* gamblers fallacy
*  * just because the stock did fall the last nine days, it doesnt has to go up next day. 9 loosing cointosses don't make the next one a winner! (aka dont double loosing trades)
*  survivorship bias
*  * current market is only made up of companies (not yet) failed. Test your strategy with the historic marketcomposition to include failed stocks too.
*  law of triviality (solve the most rewarding problems first, not the easy ones...finding a cheaper broker is less important than finding the right strategy)
*  Clustering Illusion (we see patterns everyware, even in random data)
*  blind spot bias (yes you too have all this biases your self, even if you don't see them in you)
